# Dashboard Floating Chat Implementation Progress

## Project Overview
Implement a floating chat button on the dashboard page that allows users to ask questions about the displayed data. The chat will prioritize cached query results from existing dashboard widgets and automatically reference current filter selections when answering questions.

**Scope**: Dashboard page only, leveraging existing chat architecture and caching mechanisms.
